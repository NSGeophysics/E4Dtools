Step 1:
Make topography / outer mesh

Step 2: 
Get electrode x,y,z coordinates:
Either directly from GPS file, or if only endpoints are known, use
interpEndpoints.m
to get the coordinates
Use 
elecs2points.m
to make a file containing the electrode locations for the grid.

If topography/outer mesh present, put topography/outer mesh together with points in one file.
Use  boundaryTopo.m to write the bounding box etc for inner and outer zone.

To find good boundary points:
- plot all points (x/y).
- it is easy to find x/y coordinates for a good bounding box, but it's tricky to find good topography values. 
To find good topography values, take the topography from the closest point. For example write out all x points that are close to the minimum x point and see which one is close to min and max y point. Then use their altitude. Do the same with max x.

After you wrote out the boundary with boundaryTopo.m, you may need to shift the outer endpoints further out to avoid problems with the mesh generation.


put the output of topography, electrodes, and boundary into the same .cfg file and run the mesh generation
